## Real Estate ML System

### About

This project is a complete system for predicting house prices in real time, using neural networks and modern Machine Learning Engineering & MLOps approaches.

### Data Description

later

### Goals

- Create a complete pipeline of MLOps for a house price prediction model.
- Implement a linear regression model using the Keras Functional API.
- Monitor training metrics with TensorBoard.
- Monitor logs and system performance in real time with Grafana or Kibana.
- Serve the model via Flask and create a visualization interface with Streamlit.
- Apply SOLID principles in development to improve maintainability and scalability.
- Automate train.
- Automate the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and deploy to a local server with Gunicorn.
